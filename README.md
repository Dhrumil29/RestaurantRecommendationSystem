# RestaurantRecommendationSystem
This System is using R&amp;C dataset (Source : UCI Repository).This project focuses more on data analysis and data normalization.

By analysis of dataset files with the use of R & Excel, preprocessed csv files are created with reduced dimension data. 

These pre processed files are mapped with ratings of the places and these mapped files are used for the generating recommendations.

Biggest challenge for this project is "Cold Start" Problem. 
Cold Start problem occurs when rating of the users are less compared to total number of places and attributes.

These project is built purely using core JAVA.
No in built library of machine learning algorithm is used clean the data, analyze the data or for generating recommendation.
